Final Project Android App for INFO 448 - Android App Development - Fall 2017

App Description
The Problem: To safely pilot an airplane one must ensure a myriad of safety checks and information about the upcoming flight has been reviewed and found satisfactory. In the commercial airline world, pilots have maintenance and support teams to assist with these items whereas the general aviation pilot is left to contend with them on their own. The proposed app will give general aviation pilots a status dashboard view of the airplane they are flying to ensure legally required items are complied with prior to each and every flight. This dashboard will increase aviation safety by helping to minimize pilot error in the form of missed open maintenance and safety items.

Components of Functionality
- Sending push notifications when a safety check or maintenance item needs to be completed (i.e. a reminder for a specific item that needs to be serviced every 24 months).
- Providing a dynamic, detailed checklist that the pilot will be able to use for each pre-flight operation.
- Assist in completing pre-flight operations that need to be conducted (checking the weather, route planning) 
- Providing access to new maintenance information about specific aircraft (not retrieving the actual information, as it is in PDF format,  but checking for new PDF updates)

Relevance to Mobile
We expect pilots to use the app while they are planeside while conducting their pre-flight operations. Most pilots do not carry laptop computers but do carry tablets and/or phones. The app will also consume location data and an internet connection as we plan to display dynamic data based on weather and the model of the airplane. We also want the user to keep track of the hours they flew on a specific plane.
